I am a **frontend** and **backend** developer



<details>
 <summary>Few facts about me</summary>
 
  - I have been developing for more than 5 years, as you can judge from the history of repositories on my github, as well as from links to some services created by me that have been working for several years

  - I consider initiative, responsibility, scrupulousness and thoroughness to be my distinctive qualities. I am inspired by creative approach and solving difficult tasks that no one has done before me
  
  - I have a higher technical education, which I consider absolutely useless, because the most important things we learn in life in practice
  - I am currently building a house for myself and my family and am open to new job offers
